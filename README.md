# Errantry Protocol

Side Project Idea, I had. Gonna play it out. very much a work in progress.

## Description

Errantry Protocol is a decentralized platform built on blockchain technology to manage the lifecycle of errands. It connects Errand Clients (those who post tasks) with Errand Runners (those who complete them), ensuring transparent and trustless interactions through smart contracts.

## Key Concepts

### **Definitions**

- **Errand**: A task or job that needs to be completed.
- **Errand Runner**: A person who takes on errands and fulfills them.
- **Errand Client**: A person or entity that posts errands for runners to complete.

---

## Architecture

### **1. Smart Contracts**

- Core logic for errand management is handled on-chain.
- Contracts include features for registration, errand posting, status updates, and smart account for payments.

### **2. Oracle Integration**

Off-chain oracle components interact with smart contracts and github to monitor and update errand statuses.

## Vision

Errantry Protocol focuses on creating a trustless platform for managing errands at scale. By leveraging blockchain technology and off-chain oracles, it aims to provide a secure, transparent, and automated environment for errand transactions.
